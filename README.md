# Embedded AI Project

Welcome to my Embedded AI Project! This project is a culmination of my work and learnings in the field of embedded systems and artificial intelligence. I have used an Arduino Nano BLE sensor for this project and have completed two sub-projects focusing on audio and image detection accuracy.

## Projects

### 1. Audio Accuracy Detection

In this project, using human voice i tried to detect is the machine capable for detecting the keyword or any sentences and give the accuracy,I used 4 real human voice and also some generative voice for this task and succesfully implemented this project.

## Technologies Used

- Arduino Nano BLE Sensor
- Edge Impulse

### 2. Image Detection Accuracy

This project focused on detecting and recognizing images with high accuracy.It required proficiency in machine learning , and it provided practical experience in handling large datasets and developing efficient algorithms.We used number 0-9 for checking our image accuracy

## Report

I have also written a detailed report based on these projects. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the projects, including the methodologies used, the challenges faced, and the solutions implemented. For more information, please refer to the report.

## Technologies Used

- Arduino Nano BLE Sensor
-Jupyter notebook
- Python
